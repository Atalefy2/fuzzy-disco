<h2 style="font-family:'Courier New'">Will AI Rule The World?</h2>
<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">SO, we all know that AI can do a lot of things like: Code,
 Draw, Lie, Imagine. BUT, I still know that AI cannot do anything really good. Unless in the middle
 of the apocalypse you will see the AI robots telling you that "To continue the apocalypse you can
 subscribe to the plus plan or start a new chat, AND, you cannot upload images AND, you cannot create images AND you cannot do a deep search
 so choose the apocalypse or your life"?</p>
</td>
<td>
<h2 style="font-family:'Courier New'">Should You "Touch Grass"?</h2>
<p style="font-family:'Courier New'"> We all go out-side sometimes aren't we? So i am going out-side sometimes
or in my case: EVERY DAY. the outside can be strange and wild, BUT, if you know where do 
you need to go you will find everything you want. You can find there: picnic tables, go there with friends,
bring food and, hang out. Or maybe you'll like camping and, sleeping in a tent for like 2 - 3 days?
So, I hope this presintation will help you "Touch Grass" more often</p>
